# LightningStrike_Connect_4


I made this code during my Datascience & IA course at ESILV, in the second year.
This masterpiece defeated all the other program in the class !!!
It is based on a fine-tunned version of Alpha-Beta pruning.



Here is one simple game where I got beaten by the algorithm

Here is another, I couldn't do anything, the one stone it put lead to 2 possible victory

Still impossible to beat when it start and I have the counter advantage
